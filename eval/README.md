ABX Accent Evaluation
=====================
 
This toolkit supports accent-based ABX evaluation on the AESRC* (Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge) dataset using fastABX.

What It Does
------------
 - Prepares evaluation lists for accent discrimination tasks.

 - Computes ABX error rates across and within speakers.


Getting Started
---------------
1. Download AESRC dataset (requires request via this [website](https://www.nexdata.ai/company/sponsored-datasets)).

2. Organize it into the expected directory structure:

4. Execute the scripts:
 scripts/evals/... to run fastABX and average resulting scores.
```

  [generate_item_files](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/eval/generate_item_files)
```


Evaluation Modes
----------------
Across-speaker vs Within-speaker discrimination.

Within-context vs Any-context context conditioning.

Requirements
------------
Linux/macOS (Ubuntu 16.04+, tested on Debian/CentOS).

fastABX and necessary Python dependencies installed.

 Results
 -------
Output includes:

.item files (phoneme timestamps and labels for evaluation).

.abx_score and .abx_score_average folders with ABX error metrics for dev/test.
